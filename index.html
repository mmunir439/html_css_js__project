          <h2>Misile Man of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on 1 April 1936,</b> in Bhopal, a city
            then in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal State,
            and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a Muhajir of
            Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin.[16][17][2][5][18] His maternal
            ancestors hailed from the Tirah Valley (now in the Khyber District
            of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) while from his paternal side he
            descended from an Uzbek soldier who came to India with Muhammad of
            Ghor, the 12th century conqueror, the reason why years later he’d
            name his ballistic missiles as Ghauri.[19]
